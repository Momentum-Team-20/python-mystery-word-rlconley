- computer selects a word at random
- display the word with "_" or the letters for correct guesses
- tell the user number of letters in word
- ask the user to guess a letter
    - if user enters more than one letter, tell them to try again
- evaluate whether that guess is correct
    - if correct -> add letter to display
    - if incorrect -> tell user guess is wrong and subtract 1 from guess count
    - letter already guessed -> tell user they already guessed, no change in guess count
- game ends
    - word guessed correctly -> notify user
    - user runs out of guesses -> notify user


OPTIONAL
- ask user to play again
- create difficulty levels and let user choose (based on word length)
- style the terminal output
